    <h1>Yueh-Han's timeline</h1>
    <h2>Now...</h2>
    <p>Working at Meta on product & engineering problems. For example - how might we help people grow their business via conversations in Messenger?</p>
    <h2>A while ago...</h2>
    <p>I studied at Minerva University and traveled and lived in Berlin, Seoul, SF, Taipei, and London, each for four months. Life-changing experience. I learned about different ways to live life.</p>
    <h2>From the start...</h2>
    <p>Grew up in Taiwan. Always curious, eventually skipped two years of high school to learn on my own.</p>
